### Explain the algorithm used in exercise 2. Use a flowchart, structogram or pseudo code. [2p]
#### Your answer:
picture uploaded - flowchart

### How can you get a random number in python? [2p]
#### Your answer:
First of all we've to inport python built in random module, after that, we have to call it, and tell its range, for example random.randint(1,6) -- this is a good example for a simple dice roll. But if we call it once it will give us a static random number once, so if want dinamic dicerolls for example, we have to call it evry time, when we using it!

### What does M stand for in MVC? [2p]
#### Your answer:
MVC is a modern pattern design, it separates our files for a Model a View and a Control structure. M stands for Model, we put here all of our data, wich is not a user input, because that goes to Control. So if we want to make a game and we need a tilemap we can use a matrix datastructure wich will be inside the modell, and evrytime we want to draw our map, we will call it from control, and give this data through control to the view.
